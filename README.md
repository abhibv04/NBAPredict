# NBAPredict
This is a prediction model, which predicts the outcomes of NBA games in the 2023 season
We parse the dataset, which includes box scores into pandas DataFrames that we can use for machine learning. Then we'll do feature selection to identify good predictors, and train a machine learning model to make predictions. We'll end by computing rolling predictors and improving the model.
This is a complete end-to-end project, and we'll be using web scraping, data cleaning, and machine learning.

The steps involved are:
-> Scrape standings and box score data
-> Parse the box scores in the dataset to get a DataFrame
-> Run feature selection to identify predictors
-> Train an ML model
-> Compute rolling predictors to improve the model and enhance its accuracy

Setup:
This project can be done using any of JupyterLab or Google Colab, which has Python 3.8 versions and above
The python packages used are pandas, sci-kit learn and beautifulsoup4

Data:
The .csv is attached in the repository
